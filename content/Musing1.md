# Musing I

This is my first blog, so I must write something about myself.
There is nothing much to know about me, a simple person who wants everyone around him to be happy.
Never had any goals, did things which made people around me happy.
In the process, I found a few things which are really close to my heart.

I like to code, although I suck at it. Want proof, check out github repos and see for yourself :)

I like maths, again I suck at it too. But, if I am bored you will definitely find me solving a maths problem. I solve a few problems everyday, I call it food for my soul :p (also, noone knows this fact)

I like to talk! _surprised??_ I love when people talk to me.. althought I spend most of my time keeping my mouth shut and don't want to bother others.

I love to listen! I would love to listen to you, I would love to know you. I listen to you, which means you mean worlds to me..

I love music. If you have talked to me, you would have guessed it. Start talking to me and not ten minutes have passed and here I am suggesting MUSE to you... xD can't help it :D

I love ***bass*** and I relate a lot to it. I think I am going to write about it in the rest of the blog :p

I can pick out or atleast try to pick out the guitar and bass in every song I hear.

**The next thing I want you to do is think of its importance!!**
Listen to any song, and if you know what bass is, think of the song without it. Without the bass guitar, songs in every genre sound weak and empty. It adds depth to guitar riffs, and helps the drummer establish the rhythm of the song.

If you have talked to me, I might have told you that I am a lot like bass. I might go unnoticed but if you are reading it, I want you to be happy :)

Please stay happy!
Keep talking to me :)
I am vulnerable with you, and it takes hell lot of efforts to be vulnerable. You too can be vulnerable with me, I am sure you wont regret it!

And in the end I can be a pain in the ass sometimes, plzz let me know if I cross any line :)

So, that is how it comes to an end. I am sorry for this shitty blog :) I hope you didn't like it... and this is not the complete me... I am even more shittier :)

**_O Captain!, My Captain!_**
Thank you for taking time and reading about me.. 

# THANK YOU FOR EVEN TALKING TO ME, I WON'T EVER FORGET IT :)

**THANK YOU!!**
